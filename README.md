# Project-Euler
Solutions that I have coded to a variety of projecteuler.net problems. I am presently recompleting many of them (without looking at previous solutions!) in Python. Not all code is fully optimized--some solutions are rather "hacky." 
NOTES: Only Python code restates the problem being solved. In various MATLAB solutions, MATLAB's lack of precision makes the given solution run slowly due to use of variable precision arithmetic (vpa).
