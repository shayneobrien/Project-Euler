# Project-Euler
Solutions that I have coded to a variety of projecteuler.net problems. I am presently recompleting many of them (without looking at previous solutions!) in Python. Not all code is fully optimized. Only Python code restates the problem. In various MATLAB solutions, MATLAB's lack of precision makes the given solution run slowly due to use of variable precision arithmetic (vpa).
