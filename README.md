# Project-Euler
Solutions that I have coded to a variety of projecteuler.net problems that I completed during the Fall 2015 semester. Most of the solutions are in MATLAB. I am presently recompleting many of them (without looking at previous solutions!) in Python. Not all code is fully optimized, and code does not restate the problem. In various problems, MATLAB's lack of precision makes the given solution run slowly due to use of variable precision arithmetic (vpa).
